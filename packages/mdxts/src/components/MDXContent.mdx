## Security

Always sanitize user-provided content before passing it to `MDXContent`. This includes sanitizing `value`, `components`, and `dependencies`. Failing to do so may expose you to the risk of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. See the [MDX security documentation](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#security) for more information.
