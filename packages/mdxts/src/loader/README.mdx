# mdxts/loader

Exports front matter data for MDX files and augments `createSource` call sites to add an additional argument of all dynamic imports based on the provided file pattern.

When a TypeScript file pattern is provided, the closest `README.mdx` or MDX file with the same name will be used (e.g. `Button.tsx` and `Button.mdx`).
