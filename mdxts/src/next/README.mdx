# mdxts/next

Next.js plugin to enable MDXTS.

## Usage

First, create a plugin using [[createMdxtsPlugin]] and export it along with any other configuration you need.

```next.config.mjs
import { createMdxtsPlugin } from 'mdxts/next'

const withMdxts = createMdxtsPlugin({
  docs: {
    include: 'docs/**/*.mdx',
    loader: 'loaders/docs.ts',
  },
  packages: {
    include: '../packages/*/src/**/*.(ts|tsx|mdx)',
  },
})

export default withMdxts({
  compiler: { styledComponents: true },
})
```

Note, files can be included from anywhere. This is especially useful in monorepos for including files that are outside of your NextJS project.
