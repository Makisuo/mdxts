# Routing

Define file glob patterns using `createDataSource`.

- `**/\*.mdx` matches all MDX files in all directories.

- `src/**/\*.ts` targets all TypeScript files in the src directory and its subdirectories.

## Content

MDX files primarily serve as the content layer in your documentation.

## Type Inference

When targeting TypeScript source files, the tyoe checker is used to infer the types of all exports.

The declarations exported from the `index` file in each directory are analyzed and used to generate the documentation.

## Naming Conventions

Source files named `Component.tsx` can have an accompanying `Component.mdx`. This is the same for hooks or utilities like `useHook.ts` and `useHook.mdx`.

For `index.ts` or `index.tsx`, the accompanying file can be `index.md`, `index.mdx`, `README.md`, or `README.mdx`.
