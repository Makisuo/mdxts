# Getting Started

<Summary>
  MDXTS compiles and type checks your MDX content and TypeScript files enabling
  rich interactive, and type safe content. Built on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
  [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and [TS Morph](https://ts-morph.com/).
</Summary>

## Install

The `mdxts` library can be installed using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install mdxts
pnpm install mdxts
yarn add mdxts
```

Once installed, you can configure the Next.js plugin to build a graph of content and code blocks throughout your project:

```ts filename="next.config.ts"
import { createMdxtsPlugin } from 'mdxts/next'

const withMdxts = createMdxtsPlugin({
  theme: 'theme.json',
  gitSource: 'souporserious/mdxts',
})

export default withMdxts({
  // Next.js config options...
})
```
