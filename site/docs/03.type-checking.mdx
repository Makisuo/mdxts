  title: 'Type Checking',
}

To help identify and prevent errors, front matter and all code blocks are type-checked. This is done using the TypeScript compiler based on the `tsconfig.json` file local to the project that MDXTS is running in.

## Front Matter

Validate front matter fields by passing a generic type to `createSource`:

```ts filename="data.ts"
import { createSource } from 'mdxts'

type FrontMatter = {
  title: string
  date: Date
  summary: string
  tags?: string[]
}

export const allPosts = createSource<{
  frontMatter: FrontMatter
}>('posts/**/*.mdx', { baseDirectory: 'posts' })
```

This will ensure that all front matter fields are present and have the correct type. For example, the following front matter:

```mdx filename="posts/hello-world.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
date: 2024-01-01
---

# Hello World

This is my first post.
```

Results in the following type error:

```
Error: Front matter data is incorrect or missing
[/posts/hello-world.mdx] Type '{}' does not satisfy the expected type 'frontMatter'.
Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'frontMatter': summary
```

## Code Blocks

### Allowing errors

If you want to allow errors for a specific code block, you can add an `allowErrors` prop to the code block meta field:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors
const a: string = 1
```
````

```tsx allowErrors
const a: string = 1
```

This prevents the code block from erroring when the project is type-checked and removes the error indicator and message from the rendered code block.

### Allowing specific errors

To allow specific errors, add the `allowErrors` prop with a comma separated list of error codes:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors="2322"
const a: string = 1
```
````

This is useful for educational purposes when you want to show the error message to the user.

<Note>Error numbers can be found in the type error message.</Note>

## Type Inference

When targeting TypeScript source files, the type checker is used to infer the types of all exports from `index.(ts|tsx)` files. If `package.json` exports are defined for the package, they will be used to narrow the set of exports that are analyzed when generating type documentation.
