# Type Checking

To help identify and prevent errors, all code blocks are type checked. This is done using the TypeScript compiler, based on the tsconfig.json file local to the project that MDXTS is running in.

## Allowing errors

If you want to allow errors for a specific code block, you can add an `allowErrors` prop to the code block:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors
const a: string = 1
```
````

This will prevent the code block from erroring when the project is type checked.

### Allowing specific errors

To only allow specific errors, add the `allowErrors` prop with a comma separated list of error codes to allow:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors=2588
const a: string = 1
```
````

This is useful for educational purposes, when you want to show the error message to the user.

<Note>The error code can be found in the error message.</Note>
